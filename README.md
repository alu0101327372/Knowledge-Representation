Building a knowledge-based game using Prolog. 

## Wumpus

The world of wumpus is a cave made up of rooms
connected by corridors. Hidden somewhere in the cave is the wumpus, a beast that
he eats anyone who enters his room. The wumpus can be felled by an agent's arrow; Only this one
has one. Some rooms contain bottomless holes that trap the one
that wanders through said rooms (except for the wumpus). The only prize of living in this environment is the possibility of finding
a pile of gold. You must find it!
